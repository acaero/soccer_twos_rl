The research on MASs is intensifying, as supported by a growing number of conferences, workshops, and journal papers. In this survey we give an overview of multi-agent learning research in a spectrum of areas, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics.",
